**Course Description:**  

This course covers elements of data management, descriptive statistics,  and inferential statistics. The course also examines the variance-bias tradeoff, linear regression, cross-validation, bootstrapping, subset selection, ridge and lasso regression, and choosing optimal models. 

**Course Objectives:**

1.  Students will use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Students will improve their technology expertise.
3.  Students will learn to apply statistical learning techniques.


**Course Texts:**

The principal documents for this course are [_ModernDive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R_](https://moderndive.com) (MD), [_Data Science with R_](https://stat-ata-asu.github.io/R_DS_BD2020/) (DSWR), and [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf) (ISLR)

**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
