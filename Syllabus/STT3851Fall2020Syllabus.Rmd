**Course Description:**  

This course covers elements of data management, descriptive statistics,  and inferential statistics. The course also examines the variance-bias tradeoff, linear regression, cross-validation, bootstrapping, subset selection, ridge and lasso regression, and choosing optimal models. 


_________

**Course Objectives:**

1.  Students will use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Students will improve their technology expertise.
3.  Students will learn to apply statistical learning techniques.

_________

**Course Texts:**

The principal documents for this course are [_ModernDive: An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R_](https://moderndive.com) (MD), [_Data Science with R_](https://stat-ata-asu.github.io/R_DS_BD2020/) (DSWR), and [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf) (ISLR)

**Course Grading:**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes using statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind.

You should read assigned textbook content and read/watch supplemental materials **prior** to coming to class. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must “speak the language” (both statistics and R) to demonstrate your knowledge effectively.

Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, students should spend approximately 2-3 hours on coursework outside of class for every hour they spend in class. For this three-hour course, you you should anticipate **6-9** hours per week of outside work.

_____________

**Grade Distribution:**

* 25% of the course grade will come from (25) Data Camp assignments

* 40% of the grade will come from six problem sets and four labs

* 10% of the grade will come from reproducing a data camp assignment with bookdown

* 10% of the grade will be from class participation and attendance

* 5% of the course grade will come from a presentation during the final exam period

**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
